            <p>Learning a language with flashcards is effective because it helps reinforce vocabulary through 
            active recall and spaced repetition, which improve memory retention. Flashcards allow learners to 
            focus on individual words or phrases, making it easier to build a strong vocabulary foundation.</p>
